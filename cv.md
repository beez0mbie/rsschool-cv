    In the modern world, it`s difficult to find truly high-quality and intuitive software. When you find a site or application without a overloaded interface and advertising, it immediately becomes pleasant to your soul, as before when the Internet just appeared and you explored its open spaces. 
    I want to return this feeling of nostalgia to myself and others.

    I have been working in IT for almost 7 years now.
    Started with an engineer to set up and repair a computers and related equipment.
    Then I worked as an assistant of administrator of IT.
    Then I got a job as implementation engineer of software for a CCTV development company.
    In the same company I became a manual QA, but it quickly got tired and I began to study automated testing.
    At the next work, I got a full stack QA (manual + automated), we test a web application.
    At the moment I want to become a front-end (maybe full stack) web developer and do my best to achieve this goal.

4. Skills (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, methodologies, version control, tools etc.)
5. Code examples (LATEST)
6. Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)
7. Education (including courses, seminars, lectures, online learning)
8. English (elaborate on what kind of practice you had, if any, how long it lasted and so on)
